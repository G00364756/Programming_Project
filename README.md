##Background of Project:
This project is part of the Programming Module for the Data ANalytics course offered by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, taught by Dr. Ian McGloughlin. The aim of this project is to investigate the data set known as the "iris data set", created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, with the Python programming language, based on research conducted into the value that can be gained from the data set with respect to data analytics. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate my proficiency in project management, programming, research and demonstrating work to others who may be unfamiliar with the material.

##Project Plan:

1. Research  
Goals include - 
> Investigating what the data set contains  
> The background behind the creation of the data set  
> The relevance and importance of the data set to data analytics  
> Possible analysis that can be done to the data set  

2. Creating code to analyse the data set
Goals include - 
> (Feeds on from research) Identify what type of analysis would be appropriate to use on the data set
> Code the analysis using the python programming language
> Regularly comment on code to help a third party understand the functionality
> Reference could that has been adapted or copied from other sources
> Commit code work to github regularly to demonstrate the time given to the project and the many different stages of change
> Attach relevant graphs, photos and other files to github repository to form part of the project

##Introduction to the Iris Data Set
