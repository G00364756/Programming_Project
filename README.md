##Background of Project:
This project is part of the Programming Module for the Data ANalytics course offered by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, taught by Dr. Ian McGloughlin. The aim of this project is to investigate the data set known as the "iris data set", created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, with the Python programming language, based on research conducted into the value that can be gained from the data set with respect to data analytics. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate my proficiency in project management, programming, research and demonstrating work to others who may be unfamiliar with the material.

##Project Plan:

1. Research  
Goals include -  
* Investigating what the data set contains  
* The background behind the creation of the data set  
* The relevance and importance of the data set to data analytics  
* Possible analysis that can be done to the data set  

2. Creating code to analyse the data set  
Goals include -  
* (Feeds on from research) Identify what type of analysis would be appropriate to use on the data set  
* Code the analysis using the python programming language  
* Regularly comment on code to help a third party understand the functionality  
* Reference could that has been adapted or copied from other sources  
* Commit code work to github regularly to demonstrate the time given to the project and the many different stages of change  
* Attach relevant graphs, photos and other files to github repository to form part of the project

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962),  was a British statistician and geneticist. Over the course of his career he made substantial contributions to genetics and statistical science. Many consider Fisher as the man who laid the foundations of statistics as a science.
Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish between three species of Iris using a data set collected by Edgar Anderson.
Fifty samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) were collected. Four attributes were measured from each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, all in centimetres.  

Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to find a linear combination of features which characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. This can be extremely useful in everyday life. For instance if the pharamceutical company are trialling a new type of drug to fight a certain disease, and they wish to know what type of people the drug helps cure and what type of people the drug does not help cure, then the use of LDA can aid the pharaceutical company in discriminating between these two classes of people (i.e. class1 = drug helps cure, class2 = drug does not help cure). In doing so they can better determine what types of people should take the drug and what type of people shouldn't. LDA becomes more valuable in separating classes as more attributes are necessary to be used in a dataset (e.g. can't clearly discriminate between cured people and not cured people in analysing gene X and gene Y, need to analyse more genes, new anlysis contains 20 genes, the use of more genes and LDA makes the discrimnation more clear).
